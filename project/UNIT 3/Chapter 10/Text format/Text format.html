    <h1>Text Formatting</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>In addition to the properties that affect the font, there are several properties to affect the appearance
            or formatting of your text.</li> <br>
            <li> The color property allows you to specify the color of the text.</li> <br>
            <li>The text - align property works like the deprecated align attribute would with text.</li> <br>
            <li>The vertical - align property is useful when working with inline elements, in particular images
                and portions of text. </li> <br>
                <li> The text - decoration property allows you to specify underline,overline, line-through, blink.</li> <br>
                <li>The text - indent property allows you to indent the first line of text within an element.</li> <br>
                <li>The text - shadow property is supposed to create a drop shadow , which is a dark version of the word just
                    behind it and slightly offset. </li> <br>
                    <li>The text - transform property allows you to specify the case for the content of an element.</li> <br>
                    <li>The letter - spacing property controls something that print designers refer to as tracking : the gap
                        between letters.</li> <br>
                        <li> The word - spacing property sets the gap between words, and its value should be a unit of length.</li> <br>
                        <li>The white - space property controls whether or not
                            white space is preserved.</li> <br>
                            <li>The direction property is rather like the dir attribute and specifies the direction in which the text
                                should flow.</li> <br>
                                <li>Example: <br>
                                    <pre>
