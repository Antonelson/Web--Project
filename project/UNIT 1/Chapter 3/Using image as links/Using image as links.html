    <h1>Image as Links</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>It â€™ s easy to turn an image into a link; rather than putting text between the opening < a > tag and the
            closing < /a > tag.</li> <br>
            <li>You can also select a particular shape in image to act as a way to open a link.</li> <br>
            <li>The value of the shape attribute actually affects how the browser will use the coordinates specified in
                the coords attribute, and is therefore required. If you do not specify a shape attribute, the default value
                is a rectangle.</li> <br>
                <li>values are: rectangle or rect, polygon or poly , circle or circ</li> <br>
                <li>The coords attribute specifies the area that is the clickable hotspot. The number of coordinates you
                    specify depends on the shape you are creating.
                <ul>
                    <li>A rectangle contains four coordinates. The first two coordinates represent the top left of the
                        rectangle, and the second two the bottom right.</li> <br>
                        <li>A circle contains three coordinates; the first two are the center of the circle, while the third is the
                            radius in pixels. 
                            </li> <br>
                            <li> A polygon contains two coordinates for each point of the polygon. So a triangle would contain
                                six coordinates, a pentagon would contain ten, and so on. You do not need to specify the first
                                coordinates again at the end because the shape is automatically closed. </li> <br>
                </ul>
                </li> <br>
    </ul>
