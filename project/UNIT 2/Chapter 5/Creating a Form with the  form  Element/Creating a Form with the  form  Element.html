	<h2> Creating a Form with the  < form >  Element </h2>
	<ul>

		<li> Almost every time you want to collect information from a visitor to your site, you need to use a form </li>
		<li>  . The   < form >   element can also contain other markup, such as paragraphs, headings, and so on, although it may not contain another 
  < form >element.</li>
  	<li> Providing you keep your   < form >   elements separate from each other (and no   < form >   element contains another   < form >   element),</li>
  	<li>page may contain as many forms as you like></li>
  	<ul>
  		<li> login form</li>
  		<li> search form</li>
  		<li>form to subscribe to a newsletter</li>
  	</ul>
  	<li><dl>
  		<dt> Every   < form >   element should carry at least two attributes: </dt>
  		<dd>action method </dd>
  		<dt> A   < form >   element may also carry all of the universal attributes, the UI event attributes, and the following attributes:</dt>
  		<dd>enctype accept accept-charset onsubmit onreset </dd>
  	</dl></li>
  	<li> The  id  attribute allows you to uniquely identify the   < form >   element within a page,</li>
  	<li> the  name  attribute is the predecessor to the 
 id  attribute, and as with the  id  attribute, </li>
  	<li> The  target  attribute is usually used with the   < a >   element to indicate which frame or browser window the link should be loaded into. It can also be used with a form to indicate which frame or window the form results open in when the user has submitted a form (frames are covered in the next chapter)</li><br>
  	<li>EXAMPLE FOR BASIC FORM:</li><br>
  	<li><pre>
  		< form method="post" action.process-form.php>
  			< p>
  			< label>NAME:< /label>
  			< input type="text" name="name">< /p>
  			< p>
  			< label>PHONE NUMBER:< /label>
  			< input type="number" name="pn">< /p>< br>
  			< input type="submit" name="submit" value="send">
  		< /form>	</pre>
  	</li>
  	<li>OUTPUT OF THE ABOVE PROGRAM IS:<br>
